In this task, we used UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) on Ubuntu (via WSL) to control network traffic. We tested how firewall rules affect connectivity by blocking and allowing specific ports.

We blocked port 23, which is used by Telnet â€” a protocol known for being insecure as it transmits data (including passwords) in plain text. Blocking it helps prevent unauthorized access or attacks.

We also allowed port 22 to permit SSH, which is a secure alternative to Telnet.
